The document tries to put some light on the understanding of an irrational number, The Champernowne Constant. A brief description of the constant and some of its applications are included in the report. A research and interview on the constant was conducted with a resource who is familiar with Champernowne constant. My interviewee tried to answer most common questions about the constant in a questionnaire that also describes some applications of Champernowne constant. Based on the understanding of Champernowne Constant, a calculator application is to be built, that uses this constant to perform certain operations. This document also gives the basic design details on how the product would look like,what operations is it capable of, its algorithm and use cases.

\chapter{Introduction}
\pagenumbering{arabic}
\section{Champernowne's Constant Definition}
\quad Champernowne Constant is a real number whose decimal digits are obtained by concatenating the decimal expansions of the successive positive integers:\\\\
\hspace*{30mm} $C_{10}$ = 0.12345678910111213141516â€¦\\\\
It is named after economist and mathematician David G. Champernowne, who published it as an undergraduate in 1933.\\
\section{Champernowne Constant as an Infinite series}
\quad The Champernowne constants can be expressed exactly as infinite series:\\\\
\hspace*{30mm} $\displaystyle C_m = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{n}{{10_b}^{\displaystyle (\sum_{k=1}^n \lceil {log_{10}}_b (k+1) \rceil)}}$\\\\
where $\lceil x \rceil $ = ceiling(x), ${10_b}^x = b^x$ in base 10, ${log_{10}}_b (x) = {log_b}_{10} (x)$ and {\it b} is the base of the constant.\\
\section{Continued Fraction Expansion}
\quad The Continued Fraction Expansion (CFE) of the Champernowne constant turns out to be a set large numbers with various spikes. Kurt Mahler showed that the constant is transcendental; therefore, its continued fraction does not terminate and is aperiodic (because it is not an irreducible quadratic). The terms in the continued fraction expansion exhibit very erratic behaviour, with extremely large terms appearing between many small ones. The CFE begins with 0; 8, 9, 1, 149083, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 3, 4, 1, 1, 1, 15, and the coefficient in position 18 has 166 digits. The large number at position 18 has 166 digits, and the next very large number at position 40 of the continued fraction has 2504 digits. The fact that there are such large numbers as terms of the continued fraction expansion is equivalent to saying that the convergents obtained by stopping before these large numbers provide an exceptionally good approximation of the Champernowne constant.\\\\

\chapter{Interview}
\label{Chap2}
\section{Brief introduction about the Interviewee}
{\bf Name} : Megha Kamath \\
{\bf Qualification} : Masters in Mathematics \\
{\bf Reason behind opting the interviewee} : My Interviewee is pursuing Masters in Mathematics and it was obvious for me to work with her to better understand about the Champernowne constant and its applications.
\section{Interview Questions on Champernowne Constant}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Could you mention some areas where Champernowne constant can be applied?
	\\ {\it The Champernowne constant has seemingly random numbers which are clearly well determined. This property could be useful in functional programming contexts where one would need explicit randomness which is entirely deterministic. For example, the C2 (Base 2) value of the Champernowne constant can be used as a binary random number to trigger true or false conditions randomly.}
	\item Could you mention the properties of the Champernowne constant?
	\begin{enumerate}
	{\it \item The constant given by 0.123456789101112 . . . is normal in base ten.
	\item The constant is transcendental.
	\item The constant also has a peculiar continued fraction expansion. It namely contains exceptionally large terms throughout the expansion.}
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Is Champernowne constant a Liouville number?
	\\ {\it No. Champernowne constant and Liouville numbers are both transcendental but Champernowne constant is irrational and Liouville numbers are almost rational and can be approximated quite closely by sequences of rational numbers than any algebraic irrational numbers.}
	\item Is Champernowne constant as useful as  \( \pi \) constant?
	\\ {\it The Champernowne constant is quite useful. But Pi is a constant which is there almost everywhere in mathematics. }
	\item Does it appear in any sort of geometric solutions like  \( \pi \) does?
	\\ {\it The Champernowne constant cannot be represented as a finite number due to which there have been no reported utilization in geometry.}
	\item How often do you use the Champernowne constant?
	\\ {\it As a student of pure mathematics I do not use the Champernowne constant quite often.}
	\item Has the Champernowne constant ever been used in any major proofs? 
	\\ {\it No.}
	\item Can it be expressed in terms of e,  \( \pi \) or both? 
	\\ {\it No.}
	\item What works of Alan Turing and David Champernowne made use of the Champernowne constant?
	\\ {\it Notably, There were two major works of Alan Turing and David Champernowne, the TuroChamp and Round the house Chess. But the Champernowne constant is not mentioned to have been in any of these machines.}
	\item Of all the base versions of Champernowne constants which particular Champernowne sequence has been vastly used?
	\\{\it Base 2 (C\textsubscript{2}) and Base 10 (C\textsubscript{10}).}
	\item Who and How was Champernowne constant proved Transcendental? 
	\\ {\it The Champernowne constant was shown to be transcendental by Kurt Mahler in 1937.}
	\item What are the alternatives available for Champernowne constant?
	\\ {\it None.}
	\item Is Champernowne constant used in Turochamp or Round the house Chess? if Yes, how does it fit into the algorithms of these games?
	\\ {\it No. }
	\item Do you think of any problem where Champernowne Constant would be a perfect fit to be used?
	\\ {\it I can actually think of 2, One being a Random Binary digit generator where Champernowne Constant of Base 2 would be a perfect fit and Two, Given a sequence of numbers (to base 10), How to calculate the position of any random number. I think Champernowne constant fits well into these scenarios. }
\end{enumerate}
\section{Analysis of the Interview}
\quad The Interviewee had moderate knowledge about the Champernowne constant. She was able to explain the basic characteristics of the constant with logical examples (mentioned in the response to the interview questions). The practical applications of the constant have been limited and the interviewee was able to explain one particular area where the constant (its base 2 value) is widely used to generate the randomized binary numbers.
